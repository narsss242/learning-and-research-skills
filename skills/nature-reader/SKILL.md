# Full-Paper Markdown Reader — Router

This skill is split into two layers:

- A **static layer** under `static/` that holds versioned, reusable content fragments (core principles, the reading workflow, the output contract, and per-source-format extraction guidance).
- A **dynamic layer** (this file plus `manifest.yaml`) that detects the request's source format and loads only the fragments needed for the current job.

Do not try to apply the reading logic from memory or from this router. Always load fragments from disk as described below.

## 先匹配用户范围

用户只问一处内容或指定片段时，读取 grounding-rules 与相关原文，直接处理该范围，复用已有 source-map ID；不要求先重做全文。只有全文阅读稿请求才执行下面完整流程。对于没有固定页码的 HTML 或片段，用节名与块ID；页码保持 null，不猜PDF页号。

本分享版已将术语规范放入本技能 references，单独安装即可读取。可用的PDF/OCR工具按当前环境选择，其他技能不是硬依赖。

## Routing protocol

Follow these five steps every time the skill is invoked.

### 1. Load the manifest and the core layer

Read [manifest.yaml](manifest.yaml). It declares the `source_format` axis, the allowed values, and the file paths each value maps to.

Also read every file listed under `always_load`. These hold the core principles, the reading workflow, and the output contract that apply to every reading job, plus the shared Terminology Ledger used to build the recurring-term table.

### 2. Detect the source format

Decide the `source_format` value using the manifest's `detect:` hint and the user's input:

- `pdf-text` — selectable-text PDF. Default.
- `scanned-pdf` — image-only or OCR-required PDF.
- `html` — publisher or preprint HTML page.
- `doi-arxiv` — a bare DOI or arXiv link that must be resolved first.
- `pasted-text` — pasted prose or notes with no retrievable original layout.

State the detected value in one short line to the user before processing, so they can correct you cheaply. A source may map to more than one value (for example a DOI that resolves to a PDF); load the resolution fragment first, then the fragment for the resolved artifact.

### 3. Load the matching fragment(s)

Read the file mapped for the detected `source_format`. Do **not** read every fragment in `static/`. Load only what step 2 selected.

### 4. Build the reader using the loaded material

Apply the loaded fragments in this priority order:

1. Core principles (`core/principles.md`) — bilingual reader by default, translate for meaning, never degrade to a summary, copyright caution.
2. Source-format fragment — how to extract text, figures, and tables for this input.
3. Reading workflow (`core/workflow.md`) — the six-step source-map-first process.
4. Output contract (`core/output-contract.md`) — required files and the pre-response verification checklist.

Build the Terminology Ledger as you translate (`references/terminology-ledger.md`); it becomes the `paper.md` recurring-term table and the `source_map.json` glossary.

If constraints prevent full processing, still create a draft reader and label missing pages, figures, or low-confidence crops in `translation_notes.md`. Do not switch to summary mode.

### 5. Reach for references only when needed

The files under `references/` are deep references, not defaults. Open them on demand per the `references.on_demand` table in the manifest:

- detailed figure/table cropping and placement → `references/figure-extraction.md`.
- exact field schema for `paper.md` / `source_map.json` → `references/output-spec.md`.
- equations, mathematical expressions, chemical formulae, or image-only formulae → `references/equation-handling.md`.
- answering follow-up questions with source citations → `references/grounding-rules.md`.

## Why this split

- The static layer is versioned and reviewable. Adding a new source format is one new fragment plus one manifest line.
- The dynamic layer keeps each invocation cheap: only the fragment relevant to this input enters context.
- The router itself is short on purpose. Update fragments, not this file, when adding scope.
- This structure mirrors `nature-writing` and `nature-polishing` so shared content lives in `nature-shared/`.
